### Projects

#### Week 5 Module 7 Assessment 7
<img width="1125" height="385" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-08 at 2 50 06 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc2825d1-5b5b-4fc4-9d45-580fd521702c" />

#### - Initial project idea
The project originated from the need to estimate costs, selling prices, and potential profit margins for medical equipment used in sample collection centers and small laboratories. The goal was to create a reliable, organized resource that could guide budgeting decisions and support financial planning.

#### - Tools I used
  - Spreadsheet software (Excel/Google Sheets) for calculations, tables, and formulas

  - Charting tools within the spreadsheet to visualize financial data

  - Online product catalogs and manufacturer specifications for equipment model details

  - Basic data-analysis functions (sum, average, min, max)

#### - Challenges I faced
Creating a clean, readable layout that combines technical data and financial statistics. This required reorganizing columns, color-coding margin changes, and refining the chart. Another challenge was finding accurate pricing for medical equipment, as costs vary by supplier and region. I resolved this by cross-checking multiple sources.

#### - Other Resources
I used several manufacturer websites, medical equipment distributors, and industry pricing databases to gather model names and cost ranges. No direct collaboration was required, but reference materials were essential for guidance.

#### - Result
The goal was to create a clear cost and profit analysis for essential lab equipment, and this was successfully achieved. The final sheet includes detailed pricing, profit estimates, summary statistics, and visual charts. If expanded, I would add regional price comparisons, maintenance cost projections, and an interactive dashboard for deeper analysis. 

#### - Summary 
This project calculates and analyzes medical equipment costs, selling prices, and profit margins for small laboratories. It combines organized data, financial summaries, and visual charts to support budgeting, planning, and decision-making for new lab setups.

#### Project 2 Title
<img width="1024" height="3537" alt="1carbon" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11ee9bd4-cd54-4039-9c9f-d07e3129b391" />

#### - Initial project idea
I created this project to solve the problem of calculating student grades consistently and accurately. Teachers often need to compute quiz averages, assessment averages, and final weighted grades, but doing this manually can be time-consuming and prone to mistakes. I wanted to build a program that automated these calculations, ensured inputs were valid, and produced clear results for both individual students and the entire class.

#### - Tools I used
I used Python to write the program. Within Python, I relied on input validation techniques, arithmetic operations, conditional logic, functions, and formatted output to deliver the final results.

#### - Challenges I faced
One challenge was implementing reliable input validation so users couldn’t accidentally enter invalid or out-of-range values. I also had to make sure the quiz and assessment weights added up to exactly 100%, which required looping and careful checking. Another obstacle was organizing the code cleanly while processing multiple students—this required tracking variables, updating totals, and ensuring each step executed correctly.

#### - Other Resources
I used class notes, weekly modules, and examples provided in the course to guide my logic. I did not directly collaborate with other students, but I referred to course materials to make sure the structure and validation methods followed best practices.

#### - Result
My goal was to calculate accurate quiz averages, assessment averages, unweighted grades, and weighted grades for every student, and also compute a final class average. I achieved this successfully. If I were to extend the project, I would add features such as storing results in a file, generating summary reports, and allowing users to re-run the program without restarting.

#### - Summary 
This project calculates student quiz and assessment averages with full input validation, producing unweighted, weighted, and class-wide results. It automates grading, improves accuracy, and provides clear performance summaries for each student.

#### CS 105: Week 12 Module 15 Assessment 15
<img width="592" height="798" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-08 at 6 43 53 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c250c9ef-826f-49eb-bb93-1803e59ae478" />

#### - Initial project idea
The idea for this project came from the need to organize and analyze academic performance data across multiple years and semesters. Raw grade records can be difficult to interpret, so the goal was to build a clear, structured transcript that summarizes courses, grades, and semester/year averages. This helps track academic progress and identify performance trends over time.

#### - Tools I used
  - Spreadsheet or database software to input, organize, and calculate grade data

  - Grouping and summarizing functions to generate semester and yearly averages

  - Formatting tools to create a clean transcript layout

  - Basic data-analysis features (averages, sorting, filtering)

#### - Challenges I faced
One challenge was ensuring the accuracy of grade calculations, especially when separating data by semester and year, which required careful verification of formulas and recorded values. I also needed to address formatting issues, since transcripts demand consistent alignment, spacing, and labeling to remain clear and professional.

#### - Other Resources
I used Loyola Maryland’s course listings as a reference to format course codes and structure the academic record accurately. I also relied on the reference materials provided in class, which helped guide the layout, organization, and formatting of the transcript.

#### - Result
The goal was to create a clear, accurate academic transcript showing all courses, grades, and averages for each semester and year. This was achieved: the final document organizes data by year, separates fall and spring terms, and provides calculated averages for each section. If improved further, I would add GPA calculations, credit weighting, and visual performance charts to show trends over time.

#### - Summary 
This project organizes multi-year academic records into a structured transcript with course details, grades, and calculated averages. It improves clarity, supports performance review, and provides a clean, reliable summary of academic progress.
