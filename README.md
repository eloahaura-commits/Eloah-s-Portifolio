#### - Initial project idea
I created this project to solve the problem of calculating student grades consistently and accurately. Teachers often need to compute quiz averages, assessment averages, and final weighted grades, but doing this manually can be time-consuming and prone to mistakes. I wanted to build a program that automated these calculations, ensured inputs were valid, and produced clear results for both individual students and the entire class.

#### - Tools I used
I used Python to write the program. Within Python, I relied on input validation techniques, arithmetic operations, conditional logic, functions, and formatted output to deliver the final results.

#### - Challenges I faced
One challenge was implementing reliable input validation so users couldn’t accidentally enter invalid or out-of-range values. I also had to make sure the quiz and assessment weights added up to exactly 100%, which required looping and careful checking. Another obstacle was organizing the code cleanly while processing multiple students—this required tracking variables, updating totals, and ensuring each step executed correctly.

#### - Other Resources
I used class notes, weekly modules, and examples provided in the course to guide my logic. I did not directly collaborate with other students, but I referred to course materials to make sure the structure and validation methods followed best practices.

#### - Result
My goal was to calculate accurate quiz averages, assessment averages, unweighted grades, and weighted grades for every student, and also compute a final class average. I achieved this successfully. If I were to extend the project, I would add features such as storing results in a file, generating summary reports, and allowing users to re-run the program without restarting.

#### - Summary 
This project calculates student quiz and assessment averages with full input validation, producing unweighted, weighted, and class-wide results. It automates grading, improves accuracy, and provides clear performance summaries for each student.
